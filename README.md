## WHAT I DO


**- 🧹 Data Cleaning.**
Cleaning data is like tidying up a messy room—essential before any real work can begin. I’ve worked with raw datasets that had missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and errors. 
Using tools like Excel and Power BI, I’ve learned how to handle nulls, standardize entries, and prepare data for deeper analysis. Clean data = reliable insights.

**- 🔄 Data Transformation.**
Once data is clean, transformation makes it usable. I’ve reshaped data using pivot tables, performed aggregations, created calculated fields, and joined datasets to unlock new perspectives. 
Whether it’s preparing sales data for forecasting or customer data for segmentation, I enjoy turning raw data into structured formats that tell a story.

**- 📊 Data Visualization.**
Visualization helps translate data into something humans can understand. I’ve built charts and graphs using Excel and Tableau to highlight trends, compare metrics, and support decision-making. 
I always keep it simple, clean, and focused—choosing the right chart type and using color wisely to tell a clear, honest story.

**- 📈 Dashboard Creation.**
Dashboards are my way of creating interactive, real-time overviews that make data accessible. I've used tools like Tableau and Google and Power BI to design dashboards that summarize key metrics 
at a glance. Whether it's tracking KPIs or monitoring customer feedback, I focus on clarity, usability, and visual appeal.

Older age, emergency or referral admission, and certain diagnoses (e.g., GERD, Type 2 Diabetes) are associated with poorer outcomes and higher treatment costs. Insurance and hospital location also significantly impact treatment expenses..
